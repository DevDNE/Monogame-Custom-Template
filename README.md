## Setting Up Mac Environment:
- get both x64 and ARM .net (not optional)
- follow this closely, you need all of the vs code extensions (on vscode):
  - https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/1_setting_up_your_development_environment_unix.html
- brew install freetype
- brew install freeimage

You need to make 2 files for the the 2 previous commands
- for freetype on mac, first change: 
  - /opt/homebrew/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib -> 
  - /opt/homebrew/lib/libfreetype6.dylib
  - then run
  - sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib/libfreetype6.dylib /usr/local/lib/libfreetype6
  - or
  - sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/freetype/2.13.2/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib /usr/local/lib/libfreetype6
  - based on location
- for freeimage on mac, run:
  - sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/freeimage/3.18.0/lib/libfreeimage.dylib /usr/local/lib/libfreeimage
- command to get editor open:
  - dotnet mgcb-editor ./Content/Content.mgcb (doesn't seem to be working rn with arm over x64)
- use content.mgcb, right click, and click in mgcb editor
- launch game (for now) by right clicking project, then go to debug, then start a new instance in solution explorer
